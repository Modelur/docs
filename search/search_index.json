Detailed description is available in the Menu section.\n\n\nTabs\n\u00b6\n\n\nTabs are located below the Menu. They represent a groups of similar tasks.

Detailed description is available in the Reference section.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.03 -  Structure of Modelur's User Interface.\n\n\n\nPanels\n\u00b6\n\n\nPanels are the windows inside each tab. They represent a group of related parameters (e.g. Plot Parameters or Land Use Requirements). Detailed description is available in each of the corresponding Reference section.\n\n\nStatus Bar\n\u00b6\n\n\nStatusbar is located at the bottom of the UI. It's task is to explain to you the meaning of abbreviated text when you hover over it. You can turn Status bar on or of in Menu \u2192 Options \u2192 Show status bar.\n\n\nQuick Start Guide\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore you start\n\u00b6\n\n\nMake sure you have \ninstalled Modelur\n and quickly check out the \nstructure of Modelur User Interface\n, so you get acquainted with basic terminology and UI logic. It should not take you more than two and a half minutes. :-)\n\n\nStep 1 - Initialize Modelur model and configure it\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet's start from the very beginning. With SketchUp open you can initialize Modelur by clicking on a blue Modelur icon in toolbar or via SketchUp menu \nExtensions \u2192 Modelur \u2192 Initialize Modelur\n (as shown in \nInitialize Modelur\n section). Once initialized, go to Options menu to set Modelur UI Language and dimension units (meters or feet) according to your needs (Figure 3.04).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.04 -  Inside Options menu you can set preferred language, dimension units, default shape when Buildings are created, etc. You can find detailed information about all Options in Reference  \u2192 Menu  \u2192 Options section .\n\n\n\nStep 2 - Create Modelur Building\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce Modelur is initialized and set up, you can create Modelur Building by either clicking on a yellow Modelur Building icon in the Toolbar (1), by clicking on the \nCreate Building\n (2) entry in SketchUp menu \nExtensions \u2192 Modelur\n or by clicking on the Create button (3) inside Building tab of Modelur\u2019s user interface (Figure 3.05).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.05 - Different ways to create Modelur Buildings.\n\n\n\nRegardless of which way you choose to create Modelur Buildings, there are always two options - you can create a Building based on a predefined floor plan or based on what you draw. We will take a look at these two in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nCreating Building based on predefined shape\n\n\nIf nothing is selected in your .skp model, Modelur will create a Building with predefined floor plan. This can be selected under Modelur\u2019s \nOptions \u2192 Default building shape\n as shown below. At the moment (Modelur v0.5.7), you can chose among three basic floor plans - Square, Circle and L-Shape (Figure 3.06).\n\n\nWhen new Building is initialized this way, it is created based on the default Parameters as specified for the Whole Plot or Parametric Maps (if defined). We will take a look at those later.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.06 - Different shapes of Buildings when you create a Building and no Face or Edge is selected.\n\n\n\nCreating Building based on specific floor plan shape\n\n\nMore commonly, you will want to create your own floor plan and create Building based on its shape. To do this, simply draw a horizontal face (Modelur will select it automatically if it is being created) using standard SketchUp\u2019s procedure, or select existing face, and click on Create Building button (Figure 3.07). This will create a new Modelur Building based on selected face and default parameters.\n\n\nAlternatively you can also create Building based on selected closed edge loop. To do so, select at least one edge of the loop and click on Create Building button.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.07 - You can create Modelur Building based on any floor plan shape. Just make sure Face or Edge is selected and click on the Create Building button.\n\n\n\nStep 3 - Changing the Parameters\n\u00b6\n\n\nParameters work hierarchically in Modelur\n. This means that the object (eg. Building) first looks if its parameter in question (eg. Number of Storeys) is defined. If yes, it uses it. If not, it uses the Parameter from its parent object, which is either a Complex Building (if the Building is part of Complex Building) or City Block. If the Building finds the parameter value in its parent object, it uses it. If not, it looks further up all the way to the Whole Plot, which is a top-most object in Modelur and holds all Parameters needed to define a Building (Figure 3.08).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.08 - Example of Land Use and Number of Storeys parameters hierarchy. Modelur engine works the same way for all Parameters, but it's simplified here for the sake of clarity. For the same reason Complex Building objects are left out, but if they were present in the image, they would be placed between Buildings and City Blocks.\n\nExplanation: BUILDING 1 has no parameter defined, so it looks it up from its parent, CITY BLOCK 1. Since CITY BLOCK 1 also has no parameter specified, it looks it up from the WHOLE PLOT, where it finds both parameters, which are in turn applied to the BUILDING 1. On the other hand, BUILDING 2 has specified Parameter for Number of Storeys (2) so it looks no further. But it's missing Land Use Parameter which can again be found in the WHOLE PLOT.\n\n\n\nNow that you understand how objects hierarchy works in Modelur, all you need to remember is the hierarchy order itself (bottom-up): \nBuilding \u2192 Complex Building \u2192 City Block \u2192 Whole Plot\n.\n\n\n\n\nHold down \nShift\n key to use mouse scroll\n\n\nIf you press \nShift\n key while hovering over parameter input field, you can also use mouse scroll to change number. Use \nShift\n+\nCtrl\n to increase the step by factor 10. \n\n\n\n\nOverloaded Parameters\n\u00b6\n\n\nFrom now on we will call the Parameters that are defined for specific Buildings \"overloaded\" Parameters. This term applies only to the specific Parameters of specific Buildings. Eg. when we define Parameter for Number of Storeys in Building A, but not in Building B, only the Building A has overloaded parameter for Number of Storeys. We can quickly check which Parameters are overloaded by selecting the Building in question and opening Building tab in Modelur User Interface (Figure 3.09). There - under Selected Building Parameters panel - all overloaded Parameters are checked and ready to be changed. This is also the place to initialize overloaded Parameters. If we want to change, eg. Land Use of the Building, go ahead - check it and change its value.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.09 - You can quickly check if some of the Building Parameters are overloaded in Selected Building Parameters panel (under Building tab). If checkbox is marked, the Parameter is overloaded; this means that the Building will not change when value of this parameter is changed in its superior object (Whole Plot or Parametric Map). If you do not want the Building to have any parameter overloaded, simply click on a Restore button inside Selected Building Parameters panel.\n\n\n\nPlease note that overloading / changing one Parameter might also overload other, connected parameters. For example, when you overload Number of Storeys parameter, this will also overload Building Height and Gross Floor Area Parameters, as they are directly connected to Number of Storeys. In other words, when Number of Storeys change, Building\u2019s Height and Gross Floor Area change, too.",

Figure 3.05 - Different ways to create Modelur Buildings.  Regardless of which way you choose to create Modelur Buildings, there are always two options - you can create a Building based on a predefined floor plan or based on what you draw. We will take a look at these two in the following paragraphs.  Creating Building based on predefined shape  If nothing is selected in your .skp model, Modelur will create a Building with predefined floor plan. This can be selected under Modelur\u2019s  Options \u2192 Default building shape  as shown below. At the moment (Modelur v0.5.7), you can chose among three basic floor plans - Square, Circle and L-Shape (Figure 3.06).  When new Building is initialized this way, it is created based on the default Parameters as specified for the Whole Plot or Parametric Maps (if defined). We will take a look at those later.   Figure 3.06 - Different shapes of Buildings when you create a Building and no Face or Edge is selected.  Creating Building based on specific floor plan shape  More commonly, you will want to create your own floor plan and create Building based on its shape. To do this, simply draw a horizontal face (Modelur will select it automatically if it is being created) using standard SketchUp\u2019s procedure, or select existing face, and click on Create Building button (Figure 3.07). This will create a new Modelur Building based on selected face and default parameters.  Alternatively you can also create Building based on selected closed edge loop. To do so, select at least one edge of the loop and click on Create Building button.   Figure 3.07 - You can create Modelur Building based on any floor plan shape. Just make sure Face or Edge is selected and click on the Create Building button.",

            "text": "Parameters work hierarchically in Modelur . This means that the object (eg. Building) first looks if its parameter in question (eg. Number of Storeys) is defined. If yes, it uses it. If not, it uses the Parameter from its parent object, which is either a Complex Building (if the Building is part of Complex Building) or City Block. If the Building finds the parameter value in its parent object, it uses it. If not, it looks further up all the way to the Whole Plot, which is a top-most object in Modelur and holds all Parameters needed to define a Building (Figure 3.08).   Figure 3.08 - Example of Land Use and Number of Storeys parameters hierarchy. Modelur engine works the same way for all Parameters, but it's simplified here for the sake of clarity. For the same reason Complex Building objects are left out, but if they were present in the image, they would be placed between Buildings and City Blocks. \nExplanation: BUILDING 1 has no parameter defined, so it looks it up from its parent, CITY BLOCK 1. Since CITY BLOCK 1 also has no parameter specified, it looks it up from the WHOLE PLOT, where it finds both parameters, which are in turn applied to the BUILDING 1. On the other hand, BUILDING 2 has specified Parameter for Number of Storeys (2) so it looks no further. But it's missing Land Use Parameter which can again be found in the WHOLE PLOT.  Now that you understand how objects hierarchy works in Modelur, all you need to remember is the hierarchy order itself (bottom-up):  Building \u2192 Complex Building \u2192 City Block \u2192 Whole Plot .

This term applies only to the specific Parameters of specific Buildings. Eg. when we define Parameter for Number of Storeys in Building A, but not in Building B, only the Building A has overloaded parameter for Number of Storeys. We can quickly check which Parameters are overloaded by selecting the Building in question and opening Building tab in Modelur User Interface (Figure 3.09). There - under Selected Building Parameters panel - all overloaded Parameters are checked and ready to be changed. This is also the place to initialize overloaded Parameters. If we want to change, eg. Land Use of the Building, go ahead - check it and change its value.   Figure 3.09 - You can quickly check if some of the Building Parameters are overloaded in Selected Building Parameters panel (under Building tab). If checkbox is marked, the Parameter is overloaded; this means that the Building will not change when value of this parameter is changed in its superior object (Whole Plot or Parametric Map). If you do not want the Building to have any parameter overloaded, simply click on a Restore button inside Selected Building Parameters panel.  Please note that overloading / changing one Parameter might also overload other, connected parameters. For example, when you overload Number of Storeys parameter, this will also overload Building Height and Gross Floor Area Parameters, as they are directly connected to Number of Storeys.

Before exporting the data, you have an option to choose which values you want to export (Whole Plot, Land Uses, Buildings, Complex Buildings). By default all options are selected for export (Figure 4.02).\n\n\nFor Complex Buildings, details about Land Use and/or each Simple Building from which it is constructed can be exported.

Excel, Google Sheets or LibreOffice Calc, Figure 4.03).\n\n\nTip: When importing the data, make sure you have semicolon marked as separator sign in the spreadsheet software you are using.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.03 - Example of urban control values exported to raw CSV file (left window) and imported to the spreadsheet software (right window).\n\n\nTools\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere is a set of tools that help you work faster and more efficiently.\n\n\nOpen Urban Control Data Table\n\n\nThis will open a new, interactive Window with the complete urban control data of your model inside SketchUp (Figure 4.04). By clicking on the appropriate checkboxes at the top of this new Window, you can choose which sets of data are displayed (Whole Plot, Land Uses, Buildings, Complex Buildings ...). All values are refreshed in real-time and you can also use this Window to \nselect specific Buildings\n.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.04 - Urban Control Data Window displays all selected sets of data directly inside SketchUp.\n\n\nBy clicking on a (Complex) Building row in this Window, Modelur will select its counterpart inside the 3D Window. And vice versa - when you select the Building in 3D Window, it will get selected in the data table, too. Rows with selected Buildings are \nmarked with a light blue color\n (Buildings 1000006 and 1000007 in the image above).\n\n\nIf needed, (Complex) Buildings can also be \nsorted by their values\n. Simply click on the name of the column you want to sort by.\n\n\nFor Complex Buildings, details about Land Use and/or each Simple Building from which it is constructed can be shown. Just select \nComplex Buildings Land Uses\n and/or \nComplex Buildings Parts\n on top of the Window. These options are available for selection only if \nComplex Building\n option is selected.\n\n\nRandomize Building Heights\n\n\nUsing this functionality you can randomize selected Buildings number of storeys. Once Buildings are selected, click on this button and you will be presented with two options. If you select Absolute Number of Storeys all buildings will be randomized to number of storeys between min and max value. If you choose Relative Number of Storeys, selected Building's storeys will be randomized \nbased on their current Number of Storeys\n in the range between min and max values specified.\n\n\nThis option helps create dynamic urban solutions, avoiding too uniform look of the urban area.\n\n\nCreate Terrain\n\n\nModelur allows you to add texture to your buildings and/or landscapes. Select a surface, click on this tool and select a file with appropriate texture from your computer. Valid texture file formats are: .png, .jpg, .psd, .bmp, .tif and .tga.\n\n\nCalculate Sum of Selected Buildings\n\n\nUse this tool when you need to know the sum of Gross Floor Area and Built-up Area, Mean Number of Storeys, Parking Space Deficit for selected Buildings. Once Buildings are selected and you click this button, a temporary window will appear inside Modelur UI showing you all the numbers mentioned. Additionally, it will also show aggregated Gross Floor Area for selected Buildings by their Land Use including their ratio and number of selected Buildings (or Building Parts when selection includes Complex Buildings).\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Sum of Selected Buildings on the fly\n\n\nCalculate Sum of Selected Buildings can also be done on-the-fly, as you select and deselect buildings if you turn on this option in \nUrban Control Survey on Screen\n.\n\n\n\n\nOptimize Buildings for Google Earth\n\n\nOnce your urban design proposal is finished, you might want to export it to geolocated KMZ file, which can be opened by many programs, including \nGoogle Earth\n. Using this feature Modelur will automatically optimize all Modelur Buildings by removing all unnecessary faces. If you want, you can also tell it to export floor Edges, so that the Building's storeys are visible inside Google Earth.  \n\n\nOptions\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere you can select interface language, units and default building shape. Other options are described below:\n\n\nBuildings From Edges\n\n\nTell Modelur if and how it should create Buildings or City Blocks when edges are selected. There are three options: \nDon't Create\n, \nFrom One Edge\n and \nFrom Edge Loop\n.\n\n\nDon't Create\n option means you Modelur will create a Building or City Block only from selected faces, ignoring edge loops. If no face is selected, Modelur will create a Building in the middle of the coordinate system and with \nDefault Building Area\n (as defined in \nDefault Building Parameters\n).\n\n\nFrom One Edge\n option means you can select just one edge of a closed loop and a Building or City Block will be created based on that loop. In case you have a loop within a loop and you select an edge of the outer loop, Modelur will create a Building/City Blocks based on the outer loop and ignore the inner loop (since it's edges are not in the selection). If you select edges in both loops, Modelur will create two objects - one in the inner loop and one from outer loop and hole in the position of the inner loop.\n\n\nFrom Edge Loop\n option means you have to select ALL the Edges of a closed loop in order to create Building or City Block. Of no complete edge loop is selected, Modelur will ignore selected edges and create a Building in the middle of the coordinate system and with \nDefault Building Area\n (as defined in \nDefault Building Parameters\n) or switch to Line tool so you can draw new City Block.\n\n\nCalculate FAR Based On\n\n\nTell Modelur whether you want to calculate Whole Plot's and City Blocks Floor Area Ratio based on Gross or Net Floor Area of Buildings. \nBy default this option is set to Gross Floor Area.\n\n\nLock City Blocks Upon Creation\n\n\nAutomatically locks City Blocks when they are created. This means a City Block can not be moved around the screen. This way you avoid accidentally moving a\nCity Block and spoiling your project.\n\n\nIf you do need to move a City Block, you can unlock it by right-clicking on the City Block and then selecting \nUnlock\n.\n\n\nApply City Blocks LU Material\n\n\nEach City Block will be colored according to it's Land use (if the Land use has a specified color). You can specify a color for each Land Use in Land Use tab.\n\n\nSynchronize Land Use Panels\n\n\nKeep Land Use Panels between Input data and Survey tab in sync. This means the Land Use you select in \nLand Use\n tab will also become selected (and displayed) in \nUrban Control - Land Use\n section of the \nSurvey\n tab and the other way around.\n\n\nShow Status Bar\n\n\nStatus Bar is located at the bottom of the User Interface. Status Bar shows short descriptions of Modelur options and functionalities when you hover over them.\n\n\nShow Building's Built-up Area\n\n\nShow built-up area face at the bottom of each Modelur Building.\n\n\nMark Terraces and Loggias\n\n\nApply green color to all Terraces and pink color to all Loggias. This way you can easily see how many Terraces and how many Loggias there are in your project.\n\n\nChange Currency Symbol\n\n\nOpens up a dialog box for specifying new currency symbol. This currency symbol is shown in section \nInvestment calculation\n of the \nLand use\n tab where\nyou define estimated price per square meter for Buildings with the chosen Land Use assigned. This enables Modelur to calculate estimated cost of the whole Building.\n\n\nSave Default Settings\n\n\nYou can save your preferred settings combination as default by clicking on \nSave Default Settings\n. This settings will then be used every time you initialize new Modelur model.\n\n\nRestore Default Settings\n\n\nReset Modelur to default settings. When applied please restart SketchUp and Modelur.\n\n\nStore Land Use changes\n\n\nWhen this option is checked, Modelur will save each Land Use change to temporary Land Use specifications file. Turn this feature on if you want to copy/paste Buildings and City Blocks with non-default Land Uses between different SKP models. The file \nstored_land_uses.json\n, is saved into your Modelur \nAppdata folder\n.\n\n\nHelp\n\u00b6\n\n\nHelp section contains links to this User guide, Video tutorials, Modelur website and Modelur forum.\n\n\nIf you want to report a bug or send us a feature request, click on \nSubmit a Ticket\n.\n\n\nYou can easily check for updates by clicking on \nCheck for Update ...\n.\n\n\nEnhancements and bugfixes included in your version of Modelur are displayed by clicking on \nChangelog\n.",

Distance to Height Ratio. To calculate distance, the Building's height is divided by the parameter value. Example: if parameter is set to 2, the minimum distance will be \u00bd of Building's height, if set to 3, it will be \u2153 of Building's height.

For the latter, we advise you to turn on the \nStore Land Use changes\n option in Options menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Buildings by Land Use\n\n\nIf you need to select Buildings based on specific Land Use, you can use \nSelect Buildings by Land Use\n option.\n\n\n\n\nLand Use Requirements\n\u00b6\n\n\nButtons\n\u00b6\n\n\nAdd\n\n\nAdd \nbutton\n creates a new Land Use. When creating new Land Use, Modelur will copy parameters of currently selected Land Use into newly created one. Once new Land Use is created, you can change the parameters as with any other Land Use.\n\n\nRemove\n\n\nRemove \nbutton\n removes currently selected Land Use from Modelur model. If some of the Buildings have assigned Land Use that is being deleted, it will be replaced by default Land Use as specified in the \nWhole Plot \u2192 Default Building Parameters\n.\n\n\nEdit button\n\n\nEdit \nbutton\n opens a panel to rename selected Land Use. If you rename Land Use to have the same name as existing one, Modelur will automatically append a 4-digit UID number to it so it can be distinguished by SketchUp Material, too as you can not have two materials with the same name in one SKP model.\n\n\nGeneral Settings\n\u00b6\n\n\nLand Use\n\n\nLand Use \ndropdown\n lists all Land Uses in current model. In order to change parameters of specific Land Use, you need to select it here. Once Land Use of your choice is selected, you can start editing all of its parameters.\n\n\nColor\n\n\nColor specifies the color that is used to mark all Buildings and City Blocks that have selected Land Use applied. You can specify it directly as a hex value or your can click on the small color button on the left side of this line. Clicking on the button will open up a color picker so you can easily change the color of selected Land Use.\n\n\nEach Land Use is also connected to respective SketchUp Material and synced automatically. So, if you change a color of Land Use Material in SketchUp, the change will be reflected in Land Use color, too, and vice versa.\n\n\nAdd this Land Use values to the sum total\n\n\nAdd this Land Use values to the sum total \ncheckbox\n tells Modelur if the urban control values (eg. Gross Floor Area, Required Number of Parking Lots, etc.) of selected Land Use should be added to the sum of Whole Plot or not. If checkbox is ticked, selected Land Use urban control values will be added to the sum of Whole Plot. If checkbox is not ticked, urban control values will not be added to the sum of Whole Plot.\n\n\nAdd only Parking values to the sum total\n\n\nAdd only Parking values to the sum total \ncheckbox\n tells Modelur to add \nonly\n Parking Spaces related values to the sum of Whole Plot. This is particularly useful if you create for example an underground Garage that is not supposed to be added to the Floor Area Ratio, Gross Floor Area, etc, but you want to take into account its Parking Spaces to calculate potential Parking deficit of the Whole Plot.\n\n\nUnits\n\u00b6\n\n\nPrimary Unit\n\n\nName of Land Use primary unit, which is used in \nGFA per Primary Unit\n calculation.

In contrast to Gross Floor Area, which sums up all floor areas of the Building, Net Floor Area usually doesn't contain walls, staircases, elevator shafts, etc. This way you can quickly estimate how much usable floor area there will be in the building.  \n\n\nNFA Factor Terrace\n\n\nNet Floor Area Factor Terrace works the same way as NFA Factor Internal, but it is applied to Terrace areas only. Terrace is determined automatically by Modelur when manually editing the Building using the PushPull tool. Terrace is defined as an outside floor which is less then 80% covered.\n\n\nNFA Factor Loggia\n\n\nNet Floor Area Factor Loggia works the same way as NFA Factor Internal, but it is applied to Loggia areas only. Loggia is determined automatically by Modelur when manually editing the Building using the PushPull tool. Loggia is defined as an outside floor which is more then 80% covered.\n\n\nIf needed, you can visualize Terraces and Loggias by checking Mark Terraces and Loggias option in Modelur UI \u2192 Menu \u2192 Options. This will make Terraces green and Loggias pink.\n\n\nUnits Calculation\n\u00b6\n\n\nGFA per Primary Unit\n\n\nDefine average Gross Floor Area of one Primary Unit (eg. Apartment, Office, etc). Primary Unit is defined in \nUnits section\n).\n\n\nNFA per Primary Unit\n\n\nDefine average Net Floor Area of one Primary Unit (eg. Apartment, Office, etc). Primary Unit is defined in \nUnits section\n). Please note that this will take into calculation different factors defined for Terraces and Loggias, too.\n\n\nSecondary Unit per Primary Unit\n\n\nHow many Secondary Units are there per Primary Unit.

When, for example, you change this default Complex Building to 5 storeys, Modelur will divide it into 1S:4R, as it is closer to 1S:3R ratio than if it would make it 2S:3R. When you set such Complex Building to 6 storeys, it will divide it into 1S:5R, as it is still closer to 1S:3R than 2S:4R.

Bugfix: Bounding box is now properly refreshed when user changes number of storeys or height of the Building if it is selected and Scale tool activated.  Bugfix: Loggias are now properly defined when user modifies Building manually.   0.3.3 (Pre-beta 3)   Enhancement: Added validation check of Modelur Buildings. User is now warned if Modelur finds some corrupted building, which are not parametric anymore.  Enhancement: User interface is updated with Urban Control Indicators while Modelur Buildings are being manually edited.  Enhancement: Improved optimization and preparation of 3D model for Google Earth export.  Bugfix: Neighbor Buildings, which were too close to selected one are now unmarked when the Building is far enough.  Bugfix: Fixed initialization of .skp models which contain one-storey Modelur Buildings.  Bugfix: Fixed error when lowering other storeys height in manually modified building.   0.3.2 (Pre-beta 3)   Enhancement: Language selection dropdown now sorted alphabetically.  Enhancement: You can now copy/paste Modelur Buildings between different .skp models.  Enhancement: Improved Modelur menu behaviour - panels now close automatically after selection is made.  Enhancement: All Modelur methods moved to MODELUR namespace so there is less chance of Modelur clashing with other plugins.  Enhancement: Chinese and Spanish translations back to 100%! Thank you Edgar Navas and Xiaoqi Wang!  Bugfix: Fixed wrong dropdown translations for primary and secondary Land Use units when language is changed.  Bugfix: No more user interface freezing when the defaulut language is switched to Chinese.  Bugfix: Land Use Requirements panel is now properly refreshed when last Land Use in dropdown is deleted.  Bugfix: Primary and secondary units are now refreshed properly when language is changed on Windows platform.   0.3.1 (Pre-beta 3)   Enhancement: Added error message when uncompatible version of Modelur model is opened.  Enhancement: Improved undo mechanism for deleted buildings. They are now recreated properly; nonetheless they should be avoided as much as possible as it might lead to unexpected behaviour when used repeatedly.  Engancement: Added exporting of Urban control value survey. Users can select which data they would like to export: Whole Plot, Land Uses and Buildings.  Enhancement: Added option to choose the default shape of the building when creating it with no faces selected. Supported shapes: square, circle and L-shaped building.  Enhancement: Improved Modelur icons.  Enhancement: Improved Modelur version upgrade system and initialization methods.  Enhancement: Added Modelur Help options (video tutorials, forum, blog, ...)  Bugfix: Fixed Land Use survey calculations when opening saved models.  Bugfix: Location of built-up area face inside the building if it is not on the horizontal plane.  Bugfix: Fixed showing of terraces and loggias using materials.  Bugfix: Calculation of number of primary units (e.g. appartments) and required parking lots due to Length class rounding error.  Bugfix: Fixed saving of default settings.   0.3.0 (Pre-beta 3)   Major Modelur core engine and user interface update. Most of the code rewritten.  Enhancement: Added dynamic Land Use system, so end-users can add their own land uses. Land uses can also be renamed.  Enhancement: Added Modelur Toolbar with Initialize Modelur,Create Building and Copy building buttons.  Enhancement: Improved mechanism for duplicating buildings via Value Control Box.  Enhancement: If no face is selected when a user wants to create a building Modelur creates it automatically. User can choose between square, circular or L shape.  Enhancement: Added option to colour terrace and loggia floors so end-users can check if correct faces as marked.  Enhancement: Renaming land use material in SketchUp also renames the land use itself. Vice versa works only on SketchUp 8M1 and above.  Enhancement: Added SketchUp Modelur menu language translations.  Enhancement: Added user interface Status Bar, which explains abbreviations.  Known limitation: undoing Modelur parameter changes works only partially.   0.2.9 (Pre-beta 2)   This is the last version of Modelur Pre-beta 2. It will stop to work on 31 st  of July 2013. Please note that Modelur Pre-beta 3 will not be backward compatible!   0.2.8 (Pre-beta 2)   Bugfix: Multiple buildings can now again be created in one step.   0.2.7 (Pre-beta 2)   Exporting urban control values now also exports the values for each building and marks buildings in 3D model by their unique IDs (marks are placed to layer Buildings UIDs).   0.2.6 (Pre-beta 2)   Improved performance of realtime distance checking between buildings.  Improved VCB copying mechanism.  Improved online validation mechanism, which is now executed only when Modelur is initialized. Additionaly, it fixes an error when Modelur's validation server is unreachable.   0.2.5 (Pre-beta 2)   Beginning with version 0.2.5, Modelur works also with Google SketchUp 8.  Enhancement: Improved Chinese translation of user interface. Thank you Wantao Xiao!  Fixed changing of metric/imperial units.   0.2.4 (Pre-beta 2)   Major stability improvement when buildings are being duplicated extensively in 3d view.  Enhancement: Dutch translation of user interface. Thank you Gertjan Laurenssen!  Enhancement: Spanish translation of user interface. Thank you Diego Rodriguez!  Enhancement: 'Invisible' UI scroller. Usage: select a building, click on input field (i.e. Building \u2192 Number of storeys), press Shift key and scroll mouse wheel - selected building will update itself to the new value. Change scroll stepping by holding Ctrl in addition to Shift key.  Enhancement: Automatic fixing of rotated floor plans when creating building. Modelur now tries to create orthogonal bounding box for buildings, so they can easily be scaled.  Enhancement: Basic optimization of buildings for Google Earth export. Optimized geometry can be found in Modelur2GE layer. This feature is still in development.  Enhancement: Improved input parameters handling. User interface can now accept different styles of input data (i.e. decimals written with dot or comma, whitespaces, alphabet characters) and handles them automatically.  Enhancement: Newly drawn (floor plan) faces are now selected automatically, so it one does not have to select it by hand in order to create Modelur building from it.  Enhancement: Newly created buildings now get the default name 'Building', so one can easily found them in the Outliner.  Enhancement: Improved calculation of mixed use ratio.  Fixed bug which prevented to duplicate last duplicated building in 3d view using Ctrl/Cmd key.  Fixed bug for 'Manually drawn floor plan assumes default built area' checkbox.  Fixed creation of building when default number of storeys is 1.   0.2.3 (Pre-beta 2)   Hotfix for bug, which prevented to set plot area size and parking lots normatives.   0.2.2 (Pre-beta 2)   Huge performance optimization when opening .skp model with many Modelur buildings. Model now opens 10-50 times faster.  Optimized performance of urban control values calculation (about 30% faster).  Improved communication speed between Modelur user interface and its engine.  Improved reaction to scale tool.  Improved calculation of built area.  Improved checking of user defined parameter values in user interface.  Added Chinese translation of user interface. Thank you Huaqiao Wang and James Baq!   0.2.1 (Pre-beta 2)   Improved calculation of building volume and built area.  Fixed bug of gross floor area calculation when terrace or loggia normative is changed.  Fixed undo/redo stack (SketchUp 7).  User interface bug fixes.  Fixed bug that prevented realtime update of building control values when user changed parameter of terrace or loggia percent.   0.2.0 (Pre-beta 2)   Advanced manual editing of buildings which enables the creation of terraces and loggias. How much they contribute to gross floor area of building is defined as percentage, in Terrace gross floor area percent and Loggia gross floor area percent, respectively.  Menus added to the user interface, which now works on Internet Explorer 6 also.  Modelur now works offline too, yet it has some limitations.  Export of urban control values to .csv file.  Calculation of net floor area, based on percentage of gross floor area. Defined as Percent of usable gross floor area.  Distance units can now be switched between metric (meters) and imperial (feet).  Warnings about minimal distance between buildings (default 4m).  Simplified applying of texture to the terrain.  Polish translation of user interface. Thank you Tomasz Gutowski.  Duplication of buildings via Value Control Box together with some other minor bugfixes.   0.1.1 (Pre-beta 1)   Modelur is now available also on Apple Mac OS X.  We have also added French, German and Portuguese translations of user interface. Thank you Pilou, Burkhard and Edson from Sketchucation!   0.1.0 (Pre-beta 1)  This is the initial release of Modelur Pre-beta version.",
