Thank you Pilou, Burkhard and Edson from Sketchucation! 0.1.0 (Pre-beta 1) This is the initial release of Modelur Pre-beta version.","title":"Release notes"},{"location":"getting-started/","text":"System requirements \u00b6 In order to run Modelur, you will need: SketchUp 2017 or above, Internet Explorer 10 or above (Windows) / Safari 5 or above (OS X). Modelur works well with both, Make (free) and Pro (commercial) versions of SketchUp. Installation \u00b6 There are several ways you can install Modelur: Using universal RBZ installer. Via Extension Warehouse . Via SketchUcation Plugin Store . Note We recommend you to use option #1 (universal RBZ installer) in order to ensure you install the latest version of Modelur. To install a SketchUp Ruby plugin in RBZ format use the standard SketchUp installation procedure : We recommend logging into your computer as an admin before installing any Ruby scripts. This will make the installation go more smoothly and ensure that files get installed in the proper places. SketchUp 2016 and below: Select Window \u2192 Preferences (Windows) or SketchUp \u2192 Preferences (OS X). SketchUp 2017 and above: Select Window \u2192 Extension Manager (Windows) or SketchUp \u2192 Extension Manager (OS X). The Preferences dialog box is displayed. Click on Extensions. The Extensions panel is displayed. Click on the Install Extension button. The Open dialog box is displayed. Locate the Ruby zip file to install (.rbz). Click on the Open button. The Ruby plugin appears in the list of extensions. Modelur Location \u00b6 Upon installation, Modelur is saved to Sketchup's default Plugins folder, which resides at different locations, depending on the version of SketchUp you use: On Windows: C:\\Users\\YOUR USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\SketchUp\\SketchUp ####\\SketchUp\\Plugins\\ On OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/SketchUp ####/SketchUp/Plugins/ Preferences Location \u00b6 Files containing your Modelur preferences are stored On Windows: C:\\Users\\YOUR USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Modelur On OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Modelur All preferences are stored using standard JSON data-interchange format. Upon Modelur upgrade, these files will be automatically updated. In case you edit them manually and something doesn't work, you can always restore them using the command available via SketchUp's menu Extensions \u2192 Modelur \u2192 Restore default settings. Installation problems \u00b6 If you encounter any problems with your Modelur installation, please do the following: On Windows: \u00b6 Delete \\Modelur folder and modelur.rb file from C:\\Users\\YOUR USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\SketchUp\\SketchUp ####\\SketchUp\\Plugins\\ . Delete \\Modelur folder from C:\\Users\\YOUR USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\ (if it exists). Install the newest RBZ version of Modelur and try to license it (make sure you are online). On OS X: \u00b6 Delete \\Modelur folder and modelur.rb file from ~/Library/Application Support/SketchUp ####/SketchUp/Plugins/ . Delete \\Modelur folder from ~/Library/Application Support/Modelur/ (if it exists). Install the newest RBZ version of Modelur and try to license it (make sure you are online). Licensing \u00b6 Upon purchase, you should have received a License Key. To license your copy of Modelur, please make sure you are online. You need to copy/paste received License Key into activation window, which opens automatically when you first initialize Modelur (Figure 2.01). Figure 2.01 - Modelur Activation window. In case you are not able to obtain your License Key or if you experience any other problem, please contact us at support@modelur.com . Installation on multi-user computer \u00b6 Should you need to install Modelur on one computer with multiple users, you can use the same license for all of them. To make licensing process more simple, you should take advantage of SketchUp's built-in system of shipped extensions, which installs default extensions that come with SketchUp for every user. On Windows, the default extensions are stored in C:\\Program Files\\SketchUp\\SketchUp ####\\ShippedExtensions\\ . Extract Modelur.RBZ to that location (you should see Modelur.rb and \\Modelur folder in the root of \\ShippedExtensions folder). This way SketchUp will copy Modelur installation for every user of the computer when it is initialized. By default, Modelur will check it's license in C:\\Users\\YOUR USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\ , meaning that each user will need separate license. But you can tell it to look for the license in specific location, let's say in C:\\Users\\ so that the same license is visible to all users. In order to let Modelur know where to look for license file, you need to update the file local.json , where you need to add \"licpath\": \"C:/Users/\" entry. This tells Modelur to look for license file in C:/Users/ . To finish automatic setting of licpath, make sure you have local.json stored in C:\\Program Files\\SketchUp\\SketchUp ####\\ShippedExtensions\\Modelur\\user as SketchUp will copy its content to every user's AppData folder.

Getting to know its logic will help you easily integrate it into your regular workflow. Initialize Modelur \u00b6 Once Modelur is installed you have two options to initialize it. First option is to click on the blue icon in Modelur Toolbar. This toolbar shows up once Modelur is installed (Figure 3.01). Figure 3.01 - Modelur Toolbar. If toolbar is not visible, you can open it via SketchUp menu View \u2192 Toolbars \u2192 Modelur. To initialize it, click on the blue Modelur icon. This toolbar can be stacked next to other toolbars in SketchUp. Second option to initialize Modelur is to navigate to it through SketchUp menu Extensions \u2192 Modelur \u2192 Initialize Modelur (Figure 3.02). Figure 3.02 - Alternative way to initialize Modelur through SketchUp menu Plugins \u2192 Modelur \u2192 Initialize Modelur. Please note that Plugins menu was called Extensions in previous versions of SketchUp. Once Modelur is initialized, its user interface is opened. Modelur's main User Interface (UI, Figure 3.03) is composed of five parts: Menu, Tabs, Panels and Statusbar. User Interface Overview \u00b6 Menu \u00b6 Menu is located at the top of the User Interface. It is the place where you go to when you want to save data (e.g. export Urban Control Indicators), change preferences (e.g. Language) or get some help (e.g. open this User Guide). Detailed description is available in the Menu section. Tabs \u00b6 Tabs are located below the Menu. They represent a groups of similar tasks. Currently there are five of them: Whole Plot tab (a place to set default values for the whole plot), City Block tab (a place to set values for selected City Blocks), Land Use tab (a place to create and edit Land Uses and their parameters), Building tab (a place to modify selected Buildings) and Survey (a place where you can monitor achieved Urban Parameters, such as FAR, required Parking Spaces, etc.). Detailed description is available in the Reference section. Figure 3.03 - Structure of Modelur's User Interface. Panels \u00b6 Panels are the windows inside each tab. They represent a group of related parameters (e.g. Plot Parameters or Land Use Requirements). Detailed description is available in each of the corresponding Reference section. Status Bar \u00b6 Statusbar is located at the bottom of the UI. It's task is to explain to you the meaning of abbreviated text when you hover over it. You can turn Status bar on or of in Menu \u2192 Options \u2192 Show status bar. Quick Start Guide \u00b6 Before you start \u00b6 Make sure you have installed Modelur and quickly check out the structure of Modelur User Interface , so you get acquainted with basic terminology and UI logic. It should not take you more than two and a half minutes. :-) Step 1 - Initialize Modelur model and configure it \u00b6 Let's start from the very beginning. With SketchUp open you can initialize Modelur by clicking on a blue Modelur icon in toolbar or via SketchUp menu Extensions \u2192 Modelur \u2192 Initialize Modelur (as shown in Initialize Modelur section). Once initialized, go to Options menu to set Modelur UI Language and dimension units (meters or feet) according to your needs (Figure 3.04). Figure 3.04 - Inside Options menu you can set preferred language, dimension units, default shape when Buildings are created, etc. You can find detailed information about all Options in Reference \u2192 Menu \u2192 Options section . Step 2 - Create Modelur Building \u00b6 Once Modelur is initialized and set up, you can create Modelur Building by either clicking on a yellow Modelur Building icon in the Toolbar (1), by clicking on the Create Building (2) entry in SketchUp menu Extensions \u2192 Modelur or by clicking on the Create button (3) inside Building tab of Modelur\u2019s user interface (Figure 3.05). Figure 3.05 - Different ways to create Modelur Buildings. Regardless of which way you choose to create Modelur Buildings, there are always two options - you can create a Building based on a predefined floor plan or based on what you draw. We will take a look at these two in the following paragraphs. Creating Building based on predefined shape If nothing is selected in your .skp model, Modelur will create a Building with predefined floor plan. This can be selected under Modelur\u2019s Options \u2192 Default building shape as shown below. At the moment (Modelur v0.5.7), you can chose among three basic floor plans - Square, Circle and L-Shape (Figure 3.06). When new Building is initialized this way, it is created based on the default Parameters as specified for the Whole Plot or Parametric Maps (if defined). We will take a look at those later. Figure 3.06 - Different shapes of Buildings when you create a Building and no Face or Edge is selected. Creating Building based on specific floor plan shape More commonly, you will want to create your own floor plan and create Building based on its shape. To do this, simply draw a horizontal face (Modelur will select it automatically if it is being created) using standard SketchUp\u2019s procedure, or select existing face, and click on Create Building button (Figure 3.07). This will create a new Modelur Building based on selected face and default parameters. Alternatively you can also create Building based on selected closed edge loop. To do so, select at least one edge of the loop and click on Create Building button. Figure 3.07 - You can create Modelur Building based on any floor plan shape. Just make sure Face or Edge is selected and click on the Create Building button. Step 3 - Changing the Parameters \u00b6 Parameters work hierarchically in Modelur . This means that the object (eg. Building) first looks if its parameter in question (eg. Number of Storeys) is defined. If yes, it uses it. If not, it uses the Parameter from its parent object, which is either a Complex Building (if the Building is part of Complex Building) or City Block. If the Building finds the parameter value in its parent object, it uses it. If not, it looks further up all the way to the Whole Plot, which is a top-most object in Modelur and holds all Parameters needed to define a Building (Figure 3.08). Figure 3.08 - Example of Land Use and Number of Storeys parameters hierarchy. Modelur engine works the same way for all Parameters, but it's simplified here for the sake of clarity. For the same reason Complex Building objects are left out, but if they were present in the image, they would be placed between Buildings and City Blocks. Explanation: BUILDING 1 has no parameter defined, so it looks it up from its parent, CITY BLOCK 1. Since CITY BLOCK 1 also has no parameter specified, it looks it up from the WHOLE PLOT, where it finds both parameters, which are in turn applied to the BUILDING 1. On the other hand, BUILDING 2 has specified Parameter for Number of Storeys (2) so it looks no further. But it's missing Land Use Parameter which can again be found in the WHOLE PLOT. Now that you understand how objects hierarchy works in Modelur, all you need to remember is the hierarchy order itself (bottom-up): Building \u2192 Complex Building \u2192 City Block \u2192 Whole Plot . Hold down Shift key to use mouse scroll If you press Shift key while hovering over parameter input field, you can also use mouse scroll to change number. Use Shift + Ctrl to increase the step by factor 10. Overloaded Parameters \u00b6 From now on we will call the Parameters that are defined for specific Buildings \"overloaded\" Parameters. This term applies only to the specific Parameters of specific Buildings. Eg. when we define Parameter for Number of Storeys in Building A, but not in Building B, only the Building A has overloaded parameter for Number of Storeys. We can quickly check which Parameters are overloaded by selecting the Building in question and opening Building tab in Modelur User Interface (Figure 3.09). There - under Selected Building Parameters panel - all overloaded Parameters are checked and ready to be changed. This is also the place to initialize overloaded Parameters. If we want to change, eg. Land Use of the Building, go ahead - check it and change its value. Figure 3.09 - You can quickly check if some of the Building Parameters are overloaded in Selected Building Parameters panel (under Building tab). If checkbox is marked, the Parameter is overloaded; this means that the Building will not change when value of this parameter is changed in its superior object (Whole Plot or Parametric Map). If you do not want the Building to have any parameter overloaded, simply click on a Restore button inside Selected Building Parameters panel. Please note that overloading / changing one Parameter might also overload other, connected parameters. For example, when you overload Number of Storeys parameter, this will also overload Building Height and Gross Floor Area Parameters, as they are directly connected to Number of Storeys. In other words, when Number of Storeys change, Building\u2019s Height and Gross Floor Area change, too.","title":"3.

Known Limitations \u00b6 Although we strive to make Modelur flawless, there are some problems we can not bypass. We are aware of the following limitations, and we will do our best to improve them in future versions of Modelur: GIS import is not working well with edge cases, eg. when parts of model are on different sides Equator or when attribute names contain non-ascii characters. GIS Data import is limited to WGS84. Area calculation differs for a small amount (usually < 1%) from area calculated with GIS applications as areas are calculated using Cartesian (flat) instead of Spherical method. Live connection to Excel only works on Windows OS. Slow performance and opening of large models when SketchUp's Outliner panel is opened. Proposed solution : hide the Outliner when opening the model (and when working with Modelur). When using Value Control Box to specify exact Pushpull distance when manually editing the building to add terrace or loggia, user can input the exact distance only once. Proposed solution: please re-select face and Pushpull the face again. Complex/Mixed-use Buildings currently don't take into account terraces and loggias when calculating Gross Floor Area. Manually edited buildings might behave strange or even get corrupted when changing number of storeys. Proposed solution: make manual editing only after you will not be changing Building's number of storeys. Avoid calling undo right after Modelur model is initialized because it will cause an error.

Area calculation differs for a small amount (usually < 1%) from area calculated with GIS applications as areas are calculated using Cartesian (flat) instead of Spherical method. Live connection to Excel only works on Windows OS. Slow performance and opening of large models when SketchUp's Outliner panel is opened. Proposed solution : hide the Outliner when opening the model (and when working with Modelur). When using Value Control Box to specify exact Pushpull distance when manually editing the building to add terrace or loggia, user can input the exact distance only once. Proposed solution: please re-select face and Pushpull the face again. Complex/Mixed-use Buildings currently don't take into account terraces and loggias when calculating Gross Floor Area. Manually edited buildings might behave strange or even get corrupted when changing number of storeys. Proposed solution: make manual editing only after you will not be changing Building's number of storeys. Avoid calling undo right after Modelur model is initialized because it will cause an error. On OS X you can work with only one instance of Modelur model at a time.","title":"Known Limitations"},{"location":"reference/building/","text":"Under Building tab (Figure 4.71) you can create and modify Buildings.

Send Modelur Data to Excel (Windows only) \u00b6 Once you click on this button, Modelur will open up Excel (it should already be installed on your Windows OS) and populate it with the data from Urban Control Data Table. New XLSX file will have the same name as your SKP file and will be saved next to it. Once connection to Excel is established, Modelur will send updated data whenever you make a change to your model. By default, Modelur will create and XLSX file with one tab, named Modelur Live Data . In order for Modelur to recognize this tab in the future (once saved and reopened), make sure not to rename this tab. After XLSX file is populated with values from Modelur, you can add your own sheet and refer to it (and its cells) to add your own calculations and graphs. Setting the data that is sent to Excel The data that is sent to Excel is the same as the data that you see in Urban Control Data Table . In case you want to change which data is being sent to Excel, you can do so there by (un)checking appropriate checkboxes. When you add new Modelur objects (Land Uses, Buildings or City Blocks), Excel rows usually change. To overcome problem of referencing wrong data in your formulas when rows change, Modelur adds named cells to exported data labels so you can reference specific values based on their names. Figure 4.7.02 - Example use of Excel named cells. Store Land Uses \u00b6 Use this command to store all Land Uses of current model into external file ( stored_land_uses.json file located in Appdata folder ). This can be useful when you want to transfer Land Uses from one model to another or when copying Buildings and City Blocks with non-default Land Uses from one model to another. When copying Buildings or City Blocks with non-default Land Use from one SKP model to another, Modelur will take a look at information stored in the above JSON file. If it finds it, it will add new Land Use to existing Model automatically. If not, it will replace it with the default Land Use (and show you a notice about that). Import Land Uses \u00b6 Use this command to import all Land Uses stored in an external file. Note that this button will be unavailable if you haven't yet stored Land Uses. Once triggered, a menu will open asking you if you want to update existing Land Uses values. If you choose Yes, Modelur will update all Land Uses with new values. If you choose No, it will skip existing Land Uses and add only new ones (those that are non-existent in the model, but specified in the external file).

GIS import gives you the possibility to map GIS attributes to Modelur parameters . For example you can map GIS attribute NUM_OF_STO to Modelur parameter Number of storeys . Modelur will then use the value from GIS attribute when generating Modelur Building objects for GIS layer. Requirements \u00b6 Set Geo-location \u00b6 Your SketchUp model needs to have geolocation set before you can import GIS data. You can set the model's geolocation under File -> Geo-location in SketchUp. Supported file types \u00b6 You can import GIS data that are saved as GeoJSON (.geojson) or Shapefiles (.shp) . Files need to be saved in WGS84 coordinate system . Supported data types \u00b6 Modelur supports the following GIS data types: - polygons (can be imported as Modelur Buildings , Modelur Complex Buildings , Modelur City Blocks or Simple Building Volumes ) - points (can be imported as Trees , Waste Bins or Terrain ) - polylines (can be imported as Metro or Underground Pipes ) Usage \u00b6 Open your model in Sketchup \u00b6 Open your .skp file in SketchUp. If geolocation is not set, set it under File -> Geo-location in SketchUp. Figure 1.1 - .skp model in SketchUp. Open GIS Data Import window \u00b6 Initialize Modelur and go to File -> Import GIS Data ... to open GIS Data Import window. Figure 1.2 - Open GIS Data Import window. Gis Data import window will open: Figure 1.3 - GIS Data Import window. Here you will import your .shp or .geojson file and set preferences (see GIS Preferences section). Import GeoJson or Shapefile \u00b6 Click the ... button at the right side of the File Path field and select .shp or .geojson file that you want to import. Figure 1.4 - File Path field. Offset \u00b6 Determine the offset for your model if needed. The unit for offset is the same as the currently chosen unit in Modelur (meters or feet). Figure 1.5 - Fields for setting offset. Import as \u00b6 Set of choices that will be presented in this dropdown depends on the type of data that you imported from your .shp or .geojson file. If the file contains polygons , you can import them as Modelur Buildings , Modelur Complex Buildings , Modelur City Blocks or Simple Building Volumes . If the file contains points , they can be imported as Trees , Waste Bins or Terrain . If the file contains polylines , they can be imported as Metro or Underground Pipes . Figure 1.6 - Import as field. Import Mapping... \u00b6 By clicking this button you will import parameter mapping from a mapping ( .mjson ) file. Parameter mapping will be shown in the Parameter Mapping section. Export Mapping... \u00b6 By clicking this button you will export current parameter mapping (from Parameter Mapping section) to a mapping ( .mjson ) file. Import GIS layer \u00b6 After you set the mapping in the Parameter Mapping section, you use this button. This will generate appropriate Modelur objects and add them to a new SketchUp layer to your model. Figure 1.7 - SketchUp model with GIS layer. Parameter Mapping \u00b6 Here you connect (map) Modelur parameters with GIS attributes . Modelur will use value from mapped GIS attribute for a parameter value. For example, Modelur will use value from GIS attribute H1 as Building Height parameter value when creating Modelur Buildings for GIS layer. Figure 1.8 - Parameter Mapping area. Options in From dropdowns consist of GIS attribute name and a randomly chosen attribute value (e.g. H1 (93.8) ). We included attribute value to give you an example of what each GIS attribute contains. Hopefully, this will make it easier for you to map attributes to parameters. Modelur parameters listed on the right ( To dropdowns) depend on the type of data in your .shp / .geojson file and on the option you selected in the Import as dropdown. For example, if you import polygons as Modelur Buildings , you will see the parameters Land Use , Name , Building Height etc. If you import points as Trees , you will see the parameters Tree Height , Tree Species etc. You map Modelur parameter to GIS attribute by selecting the GIS attribute from dropdown on the left ( From area). Image 1.9 shows us choosing GIS attribute Soortnaam to map to Modelur parameter Tree Species . Figure 1.9 - Example of GIS attribute to Modelur parameter mapping. Some Modelur parameters (e.g Number of Storeys ) can remain unmapped because Modelur can use default values to create objects for GIS layer. Those parameters that currently do not have default values (and can not remain unmapped) will be listed in the GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values area. See GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values section for more information. Some parameters, for example Land Use , Tree Species and Pipe Color , offer additional mapping possibilities. See Additional Parameter Mapping section for more information. GIS Extras \u00b6 This section contains Modelur parameters that are not used for creating Modelur objects (e.g. Modelur Buildings). These parameters just contain some additional information used for placing the objects on the model. For example Ground to Sea Level for Buildings. Figure 1.10 - Parameters in GIS Extras area. Additional Parameter Mapping \u00b6 Some parameters, for example Land Use , Tree Species and Pipe Color , offer additional mapping possibilities. When you map such parameter to GIS attribute, additional mapping area will appear under Parameter Mapping area. There you can map for example Tree Species values from GIS to Tree Species values from Modelur. Let us look at Land Use additional parameter mapping example: Land Use Mapping \u00b6 Land Use Mapping area appears when you map Land Use Modelur parameter. On the left side ( From ) are listed (unique) values of the GIS attribute that maps to Modelur Land Use parameter. On the right side ( To ) are dropdowns containing all Modelur Land Use types. You map GIS Land Uses to Modelur Land Uses by selecting a Land Use type from the To dropdown. Image 1.11 shows us choosing Modelur Land Use Residential to map to GIS Land Use 1122100 - Flat in a multi-apartment building . Figure 1.11 - Example of GIS Land Use to Modelur Land Use Mapping. You can map different GIS Land Uses to the same Modelur Land Use. GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values \u00b6 While some Modelur parameters can remain unmapped (because Modelur can use default values), some can not. For example, all Metro parameters must be mapped. The parameters that can not remain unmapped and that are not (yet) mapped in the Parameter Mapping area, will be listed in GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values area. Figure 1.12 - Parameters that are not (yet) mapped in the Parameter Mapping area, will be listed in GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values area. If you map the parameters in the Parameter Mapping area, they will disappear from GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values area. Figure 1.13 - If you map the parameters in the Parameter Mapping area, they will disappear from GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values area. Dropdowns in the GIS Non-mapped Parameter Values area contain actual values that are available for certain parameter. The chosen value will be used for all objects in GIS layer. GIS Preferences \u00b6 Here you set how Modelur will perform certain GIS related functions. If you don't see the options, click on the square icon on the right of the GIS Preferences tittle area. This will expand GIS Preferences area. Figure 1.14 - GIS Preferences area. Max number of mapped Land Uses \u00b6 Land Use mapper area (see Land Use Mapping section) is generated with unique values of the GIS attribute that maps to Land Use Modelur parameter. You might accidentally choose a GIS attribute with e.g. 1000 or more fields. Then the generation of Land Use Mapper will take a long time and can even break the program. You can prevent such errors by setting the limit on Land Use mapper size. Then the Land Use Mapper will contain only the Max number of mapped Land Uses fields. Max distance from Origin before warning \u00b6 Here you can set max allowed distance between model\u2019s geolocation and the geolocation of the GIS file you imported. Modelur will not prevent you from importing GIS file that exceeds the distance set here, but will show a warning to alert you. Mapping import options \u00b6 When importing saved mapping file ( .mjson ) you can choose between following options: 1. Clear, use imported mapping only \u00b6 All the mapping fields in the Parameter Mapping area will be cleared and filled with values from the imported mapping file. 2. Merge, keep imported mapping for overlapping fields \u00b6 Values from the imported mapping file will replace values from the Parameter Mapping area. Those fields in the Parameter Mapping area that are not defined in imported file, will remain unchanged. 3. Merge, keep current mapping for overlapping fields \u00b6 Values from the Parameter Mapping area will remain unchanged. Only those fields that do not have a value set will be filled with values from imported mapping file. Update Land Use values \u00b6 If Land Uses , defined in mapping file you will import, differ from the same named Land Uses from model, you have two options: 1. Skip (use existing) \u00b6 Use Land Uses defined in model. 2. Overload (update existing) \u00b6 Update model Land Uses with specification from mapping file. Generate missing Land Uses \u00b6 When you import mapping file, it can happen that the file contains Land Use types that your model does not contain. In that case, Generate missing Land Uses option becomes important. If checked, Modelur will add Land Uses from the mapping file to the model. If not, it will use just Land Uses from the model. Fields that use Land Uses from the mapping file will remain empty. Check if mapping file was modified outside Modelur \u00b6 When you click the Export Mapping... button, you generate a mapping file that can be imported to other Modelur instances or used later. It is highly recommended not to edit the mapping file outside Modelur GIS Import Interface. Otherwise the file form can become corrupted which can cause trouble. If you choose this option, Modelur will check if the file was edited outside Modelur and warn you if that is true. Warn on Offset conflict \u00b6 If checked, Modelur will warn you when mapping file offset differs from model offset. Import mapping automatically if available \u00b6 If you select this option, Modelur will look for a corresponding mapping file when importing the GIS file (Modelur will look in the folder where GIS file is located for a mapping file with the same name as GIS file). If the corresponding mapping file is found, it will be automatically imported.","title":"GIS Import (Beta)"},{"location":"reference/gis/#gis-import","text":"GIS import is a brand new Modelur feature, which allows you to import Shapefiles and GeoJSON files to SketchUp and transform 2D GIS data to a 3D model.

File \u2192 Export Urban Design Control Values\u2026 This is used to export urban control values (such as Gross Floor Area, FAR, Required number of parking lots, etc.) of currently opened model into CSV file. Before exporting the data, you have an option to choose which values you want to export (Whole Plot, Land Uses, Buildings, Complex Buildings). By default all options are selected for export (Figure 4.02). For Complex Buildings, details about Land Use and/or each Simple Building from which it is constructed can be exported. Just select Export also Land Use data of Complex Buildings and/or Export also Buildings that form Complex Buildings . Figure 4.02 - You can select which data you want to export to CSV file. Sort Buildings by parameter value in CSV export In case you have sorted the Buildings by some value in Urban Control Data Table , the order will be preserved when exporting the values to CSV file. Exported CSV file can then be opened by any major spreadsheet software (eg. Excel, Google Sheets or LibreOffice Calc, Figure 4.03). Tip: When importing the data, make sure you have semicolon marked as separator sign in the spreadsheet software you are using.

File \u2192 Download OSM 3D Buildings In order to generate Open Street Map (OSM) 3D Building's volumes (Figure 4.04), you first need to geolocate your model using SketchUp's geolocation feature (File -> Geo-location -> Add Location\u2026). Once you have geolocated your model, hitting Download OSM 3D Buildings button will create you building volumes for selected area. The new volumes will be placed into a separate group and placed on separate layer. If you wish to place building's volumes onto the terrain, make sure to select it before triggering download. In case you would like to create buildings on your own terrain (not one generated by SketchUp), just select it and Modelur will filter the imported building volumes and place it onto it. Figure 4.04 - Since Modelur 2020.0.03 you can add context to your model via OSM data import. Default Building Heights Note that not all buildings provided by OSM have their height parameter defined. When this is the case, Modelur will take default building parameter from Whole Plot or City Block at the time of creation. File \u2192 Download OSM 2D Urban Morphology In order to generate OSM 2D Urban Morphology, you first need to geolocate your model using SketchUp's geolocation feature (File -> Geo-location -> Add Location\u2026). Once you have geolocated your model, hitting Download OSM 2D Urban Morphology button will create you floor plans of buildings for selected area. The new floor plans will be placed into a separate group and placed on separate layer. Tools \u00b6 Here is a set of tools that help you work faster and more efficiently. Open Urban Control Data Table This will open a new, interactive Window with the complete urban control data of your model inside SketchUp (Figure 4.04). By clicking on the appropriate checkboxes at the top of this new Window, you can choose which sets of data are displayed (Whole Plot, Land Uses, Buildings, Complex Buildings ...). All values are refreshed in real-time and you can also use this Window to select specific Buildings . Figure 4.04 - Urban Control Data Window displays all selected sets of data directly inside SketchUp. By clicking on a (Complex) Building row in this Window, Modelur will select its counterpart inside the 3D Window. And vice versa - when you select the Building in 3D Window, it will get selected in the data table, too. Rows with selected Buildings are marked with a light blue color (Buildings 1000006 and 1000007 in the image above). If needed, (Complex) Buildings can also be sorted by their values . Simply click on the name of the column you want to sort by. For Complex Buildings, details about Land Use and/or each Simple Building from which it is constructed can be shown. Just select Complex Buildings Land Uses and/or Complex Buildings Parts on top of the Window. These options are available for selection only if Complex Building option is selected. Randomize Building Heights Using this functionality you can randomize selected Buildings number of storeys. Once Buildings are selected, click on this button and you will be presented with two options. If you select Absolute Number of Storeys all buildings will be randomized to number of storeys between min and max value. If you choose Relative Number of Storeys, selected Building's storeys will be randomized based on their current Number of Storeys in the range between min and max values specified. This option helps create dynamic urban solutions, avoiding too uniform look of the urban area. // : # (Modelur allows you to add texture to your buildings and/or landscapes. Select a surface, click on this tool and select a file with appropriate texture from your computer. Valid texture file formats are: .png, .jpg, .psd, .bmp, .tif and .tga.) Place Buildings on Selected Terrain Using this will \"drop\" all Modelur Buildings to the terrain of your choice. This is particularly useful when working on sloped terrains and you need the buildings to sit nicely on it. In order to use this functonality, just select the terrain in question and click this button. Calculate Form Factor Form Factor calculation is used to estimate the potential of Building's energy efficiency. The lower the Form Factor, the more compact a Building is. And the more compact a Building is, the lower are the energy losses for a given floor space. Modelur calculates the Form Factor in two ways that are most commonly used nowadays: Heat Loss Form Factor (FF) is the ratio between the Building's envelope area (EA) and it's Net Floor Area (NFA). Form Factor is calculated as FF = EA / NFA. Source: NHBC: Foundation Shape and Form The Heat Loss Form Factor is a number generally between 0.5 and 5, with a lower number indicating a more compact building. Passivhaus buildings aim to achieve 3 or less ( source ). Surface to Volume Ratio (SVR) is the ratio between the Building's envelope area (EA) and it's volume (V). Surface to Volume Ratio is calculated as SVR = EA / V. Note: The numeric value of Surface to Volume Ratio is dependent on the units (metric or imperial) that are chosen. Source: Researchgate: The Impact of the Shape Factor on Final Energy Demand in Residential Buildings in Nordic Climates . The Surface to Volume Ratio for a typical single family house is 0.8 - 1.0 1/m. According to some sources, the recommended Surface to Volume Ratio for a passive house is \u2264 0.8 1/m; according to another source 0.5 1/m ( source ). Building's envelope area is the sum of areas of external faces of the Building (e.g. walls, roofs, terraces). Form Factor Calculation is also available through Context menu You can call Form Factor Calculation also via Context menu. To do so, just right-click on the Building and select Modelur \u2192 Calculate Form Factor. Optimize Buildings for Google Earth Once your urban design proposal is finished, you might want to export it to geolocated KMZ file, which can be opened by many programs, including Google Earth . Using this feature Modelur will automatically optimize all Modelur Buildings by removing all unnecessary faces. If you want, you can also tell it to export floor Edges, so that the Building's storeys are visible inside Google Earth. Options \u00b6 Language Set Modelur to your preferred language. Note that Modelur is officially supported in English only for time being. Units Set chosen units, either metric (meters) or imperial (feet). Switching this option will also switch SketchUp's dimension units. Default Building Shape When nothing is selected in your model, Modelur can create a Building or Complex Building at model's origin. Here you can set what shape should such default building be (Square, Circle or L-Shape). If you selecte empty value in the dropdown, Modelur will not create new (Complex) Building if there are no proper objects (eg. Face or closed Edge loop) in the selection. Buildings From Edges Tell Modelur if and how it should create Buildings or City Blocks when edges are selected. There are three options: Don't Create , From One Edge and From Edge Loop . Don't Create option means you Modelur will create a Building or City Block only from selected faces, ignoring edge loops. If no face is selected, Modelur will create a Building in the middle of the coordinate system and with Default Building Area (as defined in Default Building Parameters ). From One Edge option means you can select just one edge of a closed loop and a Building or City Block will be created based on that loop. In case you have a loop within a loop and you select an edge of the outer loop, Modelur will create a Building/City Blocks based on the outer loop and ignore the inner loop (since it's edges are not in the selection). If you select edges in both loops, Modelur will create two objects - one in the inner loop and one from outer loop and hole in the position of the inner loop. From Edge Loop option means you have to select ALL the Edges of a closed loop in order to create Building or City Block. Of no complete edge loop is selected, Modelur will ignore selected edges and create a Building in the middle of the coordinate system and with Default Building Area (as defined in Default Building Parameters ) or switch to Line tool so you can draw new City Block. Calculate FAR Based On Tell Modelur whether you want to calculate Whole Plot's and City Blocks Floor Area Ratio based on Gross or Net Floor Area of Buildings. By default this option is set to Gross Floor Area. Relation to Sum of Selected Buildings Calculate FAR Based On Gross or Net Floor Area preference determines also which value (Gross or Net) is shown when Heads-up Display is showing Sum of Selected Buildings. Lock City Blocks Upon Creation Automatically locks City Blocks when they are created. This means a City Block can not be moved around the screen. This way you avoid accidentally moving a City Block and spoiling your project. If you do need to move a City Block, you can unlock it by right-clicking on the City Block and then selecting Unlock . Apply City Blocks LU Material Each City Block will be colored according to it's Land use (if the Land use has a specified color). You can specify a color for each Land Use in Land Use tab. Synchronize Land Use Panels Keep Land Use Panels between Input data and Survey tab in sync. This means the Land Use you select in Land Use tab will also become selected (and displayed) in Urban Control - Land Use section of the Survey tab and the other way around. Show Status Bar Status Bar is located at the bottom of the User Interface. Status Bar shows short descriptions of Modelur options and functionalities when you hover over them. Show Building's Built-up Area Show built-up area face at the bottom of each Modelur Building. Mark Terraces and Loggias Apply green color to all Terraces and pink color to all Loggias. This way you can easily see how many Terraces and how many Loggias there are in your project. Sync Building's Layer If this option is turned on, Modelur will make sure that all Modelur Building's Entities (Edges and Faces) are placed on the same layer as the Building itself. The same is true for Complex Buildings and City Blocks. By default this option is turned on. Change Currency Symbol Opens up a dialog box for specifying new currency symbol. This currency symbol is shown in section Investment calculation of the Land use tab where you define estimated price per square meter for Buildings with the chosen Land Use assigned. This enables Modelur to calculate estimated cost of the whole Building. Save Default Settings You can save your preferred settings combination as default by clicking on Save Default Settings . This settings will then be used every time you initialize new Modelur model. Restore Default Settings Reset Modelur to default settings. When applied please restart SketchUp and Modelur. Store Land Use changes When this option is checked, Modelur will save each Land Use change to temporary Land Use specifications file. Turn this feature on if you want to copy/paste Buildings and City Blocks with non-default Land Uses between different SKP models.

Form Factor is calculated as FF = EA / NFA. Source: NHBC: Foundation Shape and Form The Heat Loss Form Factor is a number generally between 0.5 and 5, with a lower number indicating a more compact building. Passivhaus buildings aim to achieve 3 or less ( source ). Surface to Volume Ratio (SVR) is the ratio between the Building's envelope area (EA) and it's volume (V). Surface to Volume Ratio is calculated as SVR = EA / V. Note: The numeric value of Surface to Volume Ratio is dependent on the units (metric or imperial) that are chosen. Source: Researchgate: The Impact of the Shape Factor on Final Energy Demand in Residential Buildings in Nordic Climates . The Surface to Volume Ratio for a typical single family house is 0.8 - 1.0 1/m. According to some sources, the recommended Surface to Volume Ratio for a passive house is \u2264 0.8 1/m; according to another source 0.5 1/m ( source ). Building's envelope area is the sum of areas of external faces of the Building (e.g. walls, roofs, terraces). Form Factor Calculation is also available through Context menu You can call Form Factor Calculation also via Context menu. To do so, just right-click on the Building and select Modelur \u2192 Calculate Form Factor. Optimize Buildings for Google Earth Once your urban design proposal is finished, you might want to export it to geolocated KMZ file, which can be opened by many programs, including Google Earth . Using this feature Modelur will automatically optimize all Modelur Buildings by removing all unnecessary faces. If you want, you can also tell it to export floor Edges, so that the Building's storeys are visible inside Google Earth.","title":"Tools"},{"location":"reference/menu/#options","text":"Language Set Modelur to your preferred language. Note that Modelur is officially supported in English only for time being. Units Set chosen units, either metric (meters) or imperial (feet). Switching this option will also switch SketchUp's dimension units. Default Building Shape When nothing is selected in your model, Modelur can create a Building or Complex Building at model's origin. Here you can set what shape should such default building be (Square, Circle or L-Shape). If you selecte empty value in the dropdown, Modelur will not create new (Complex) Building if there are no proper objects (eg. Face or closed Edge loop) in the selection. Buildings From Edges Tell Modelur if and how it should create Buildings or City Blocks when edges are selected. There are three options: Don't Create , From One Edge and From Edge Loop . Don't Create option means you Modelur will create a Building or City Block only from selected faces, ignoring edge loops. If no face is selected, Modelur will create a Building in the middle of the coordinate system and with Default Building Area (as defined in Default Building Parameters ). From One Edge option means you can select just one edge of a closed loop and a Building or City Block will be created based on that loop. In case you have a loop within a loop and you select an edge of the outer loop, Modelur will create a Building/City Blocks based on the outer loop and ignore the inner loop (since it's edges are not in the selection). If you select edges in both loops, Modelur will create two objects - one in the inner loop and one from outer loop and hole in the position of the inner loop. From Edge Loop option means you have to select ALL the Edges of a closed loop in order to create Building or City Block. Of no complete edge loop is selected, Modelur will ignore selected edges and create a Building in the middle of the coordinate system and with Default Building Area (as defined in Default Building Parameters ) or switch to Line tool so you can draw new City Block. Calculate FAR Based On Tell Modelur whether you want to calculate Whole Plot's and City Blocks Floor Area Ratio based on Gross or Net Floor Area of Buildings. By default this option is set to Gross Floor Area. Relation to Sum of Selected Buildings Calculate FAR Based On Gross or Net Floor Area preference determines also which value (Gross or Net) is shown when Heads-up Display is showing Sum of Selected Buildings. Lock City Blocks Upon Creation Automatically locks City Blocks when they are created. This means a City Block can not be moved around the screen. This way you avoid accidentally moving a City Block and spoiling your project. If you do need to move a City Block, you can unlock it by right-clicking on the City Block and then selecting Unlock . Apply City Blocks LU Material Each City Block will be colored according to it's Land use (if the Land use has a specified color). You can specify a color for each Land Use in Land Use tab. Synchronize Land Use Panels Keep Land Use Panels between Input data and Survey tab in sync. This means the Land Use you select in Land Use tab will also become selected (and displayed) in Urban Control - Land Use section of the Survey tab and the other way around. Show Status Bar Status Bar is located at the bottom of the User Interface. Status Bar shows short descriptions of Modelur options and functionalities when you hover over them. Show Building's Built-up Area Show built-up area face at the bottom of each Modelur Building. Mark Terraces and Loggias Apply green color to all Terraces and pink color to all Loggias. This way you can easily see how many Terraces and how many Loggias there are in your project. Sync Building's Layer If this option is turned on, Modelur will make sure that all Modelur Building's Entities (Edges and Faces) are placed on the same layer as the Building itself. The same is true for Complex Buildings and City Blocks. By default this option is turned on. Change Currency Symbol Opens up a dialog box for specifying new currency symbol. This currency symbol is shown in section Investment calculation of the Land use tab where you define estimated price per square meter for Buildings with the chosen Land Use assigned. This enables Modelur to calculate estimated cost of the whole Building. Save Default Settings You can save your preferred settings combination as default by clicking on Save Default Settings . This settings will then be used every time you initialize new Modelur model. Restore Default Settings Reset Modelur to default settings. When applied please restart SketchUp and Modelur. Store Land Use changes When this option is checked, Modelur will save each Land Use change to temporary Land Use specifications file.

Create Complex Building \u00b6 This button will create Complex (Mixed-use) Building. Complex Building is a group of Buildings (with different Land Use) combined into one Building. You can edit Complex Building as a whole or each part separately. If you want to edit Complex Building as a whole, select the whole Complex Building by clicking on it. It's parameters will be displayed in the Building tab where you can edit them. If you want to edit only specific parts of a Complex Building, enter the Complex Building as you would any SketchUp Group by double clicking on it first, then select part of the Complex Building by clicking on it once. Parameters of that part will be displayed in the Building tab where you can edit them. Figure 5.01 - Whole Complex Building is selected as a group (dotted line). Inside this group a part of Complex Building is selected (blue line). This part can now be edited (for eg. Land Use changed) in Building tab. Complex Building Parts ratio Modelur remembers the original storeys ratio of the Complex Building once you create them. By default it is 1 storey Service and 3 storeys Residential. If you create Complex Building by combining existing simple Buildings, Modelur will remember the ratio based on current state of each Building that will become part of Complex Building. Let's assume you have created a default Complex Building, which has 1 storey of Service and 3 storeys of Residential area (1S:3R). When, for example, you change this default Complex Building to 5 storeys, Modelur will divide it into 1S:4R, as it is closer to 1S:3R ratio than if it would make it 2S:3R. When you set such Complex Building to 6 storeys, it will divide it into 1S:5R, as it is still closer to 1S:3R than 2S:4R. But when changed to 7 storeys, Modelur will add another Service storey, making the building 2S:5R, which is closer to 1S:3S than 1S:6R.

If the Parameter in [City Block](city_block) or [Building](building) is not overloaded, the values defined here will be used. Compact and Extended View In case you don't see separators between parameters you can turn them on using the extend icon on the top right corner of each panel: . Plot Parameters \u00b6 Inside the Plot Parameters panel you can define default parameters that are valid for the whole development area unless they are overloaded by specific City Blocks . Plot Area Plot area represents the size of the whole development area . This parameter is used to calculate Floor Area Ratio (FAR = Gross Floor Area/Plot Area) and Site Coverage (Built-up Area/Plot Area) of the whole development area. In case you have any City Blocks defined, Modelur will automatically sum up their areas and display it here (and also use it in calculations). However, if you want you can overload sum of City Block's areas by simply entering the area size of your choice. If you then prefer to use calculated value instead, just delete your specified area size and Modelur will set it back to sum of City Blocks. Default Land Use Using default Land Use dropdown menu you can set the default Land Use for City Blocks and Buildings. Land Uses are used to calculate Building's units (eg. apartments, residents, offices, etc), parking requirements, green area requirements, etc. To learn more about these settings, please visit Land Use section of this page. General Site Limits \u00b6 Under General Site Limits you can set the default constraints set by zoning ordinance so that Modelur can warn you if they are exceeded. But it will not prevent you from exceeding them. In case your development model exceeds set Zoning Constraints, they will become red , to warn you about it (Figure 4.22). Once the model is fixed to meet constraints again (or when zoning ordinance constraints themselves are updated), exceeded parameters will turn back to black. These parameters can also be set for each City Block separately. When defined on City Block level, they are valid only for that City Block (including the Buildings Heights). Figure 4.22 - When text color in Modelur user interface turns red, the Parameters in question are exceeded. Maximum Permitted FAR Using maximum permitted Floor Area Ratio you can define allowable FAR for the whole development area. In case FAR value for the Whole Plot is exceeded, this line will become red, to warn you about it. If you don't want Modelur to validate achieved FAR, simply erase this value and hit Enter . Max. Permitted Site Coverage Using maximum permitted Site Coverage you can define allowable Site Coverage for the whole development area. In case Site Coverage value for the Whole Plot is exceeded, this line will become red, to warn you about it. If you don't want Modelur to validate achieved Site Coverage, simply erase this value and hit Enter . Max. Permitted Building Height Using maximum permitted Building Height you can define height restrictions for the whole development area. In case some Building is higher than specified here, this line will become red, to warn you about it. If you don't want Modelur to validate Buildings Heights, simply erase this and hit Enter . Distances \u00b6 Percentage of Building Height: Percentage of Building Height is used to calculate minimum distance between two Buildings based on their heights. Example: if this parameter is set to 50% and Building is 20 meters high, the minimum distance required will be 10 meters (which is 50% from 20 meters). Deprecated: In versions of Modelur prior to 2018.1, this option was named Min. Distance to Height Ratio. To calculate distance, the Building's height is divided by the parameter value. Example: if parameter is set to 2, the minimum distance will be \u00bd of Building's height, if set to 3, it will be \u2153 of Building's height. If the Buildings are placed closer than the calculated distance, they will be marked red (assuming that Too low distance between Buildings is active). Min. Dist. Between Buildings Minimum distance between Buildings is the absolute distance (in meters or feet) between any two Buildings. If the Buildings are placed closer than this specified distance, they will be marked red (assuming that Too low distance between Buildings is active). Default Building Parameters \u00b6 Default Building Parameters inside the Whole Plot tab are the topmost Building parameters in Modelur's hierarchy . This means that if the parameter in question is not defined by the Building itself (or any object in it's hierarchy, eg. City Block ), Modelur will apply the values defined here to the Building. For example, when you create a new Building, it will contain number of storeys, Land Use, etc as defined here. Building Height \u00b6 Building Height Building height sets how tall should the Building be in chosen units (metric or imperial). When changing Number of Storeys, First Storey Height and Other Storey Heights this parameter will adapt itself automatically. Number of Storeys Number of storeys sets the number of Building's storeys. When you change this parameter, Building Height (described above) will be adapted automatically to reflect calculated height based on Number of Storeys and First and Other storeys Height (described below). Building Areas \u00b6 Built-up Area Built-up area sets the default floor area size of the Building. Please note that this value will be automatically overloaded when creating the Building (to keep drawn floor area size) unless you check the Manually drawn floor plan assumes default Built-up Area under Building tab \u2192 Editing Modes of Building. Built-up Area will automatically be adapted if you change Gross Floor Area (described below) to match the division of Gross Floor Area with Number of Storeys. Gross Floor Area Gross floor area parameter is used to define default gross floor area size of the Building. If Building is created from scratch (no horizontal SketchUp Face is selected), this will be used to determine size of the Building (in combination with Number of Storeys). Storey Heights \u00b6 First Storey Height First storey height is used to set the default height of Building's ground floor. Changing this parameter will change default Building Height, too. Other Storeys Height Other storeys height is used to set the default height of all Building's storeys above ground floor.

Land Uses are used to calculate Building's units (eg. apartments, residents, offices, etc), parking requirements, green area requirements, etc. To learn more about these settings, please visit Land Use section of this page.","title":"Plot Parameters"},{"location":"reference/whole_plot/#general-site-limits","text":"Under General Site Limits you can set the default constraints set by zoning ordinance so that Modelur can warn you if they are exceeded. But it will not prevent you from exceeding them. In case your development model exceeds set Zoning Constraints, they will become red , to warn you about it (Figure 4.22). Once the model is fixed to meet constraints again (or when zoning ordinance constraints themselves are updated), exceeded parameters will turn back to black. These parameters can also be set for each City Block separately. When defined on City Block level, they are valid only for that City Block (including the Buildings Heights). Figure 4.22 - When text color in Modelur user interface turns red, the Parameters in question are exceeded. Maximum Permitted FAR Using maximum permitted Floor Area Ratio you can define allowable FAR for the whole development area. In case FAR value for the Whole Plot is exceeded, this line will become red, to warn you about it. If you don't want Modelur to validate achieved FAR, simply erase this value and hit Enter . Max. Permitted Site Coverage Using maximum permitted Site Coverage you can define allowable Site Coverage for the whole development area. In case Site Coverage value for the Whole Plot is exceeded, this line will become red, to warn you about it. If you don't want Modelur to validate achieved Site Coverage, simply erase this value and hit Enter . Max. Permitted Building Height Using maximum permitted Building Height you can define height restrictions for the whole development area.

Example: if this parameter is set to 50% and Building is 20 meters high, the minimum distance required will be 10 meters (which is 50% from 20 meters). Deprecated: In versions of Modelur prior to 2018.1, this option was named Min. Distance to Height Ratio. To calculate distance, the Building's height is divided by the parameter value. Example: if parameter is set to 2, the minimum distance will be \u00bd of Building's height, if set to 3, it will be \u2153 of Building's height. If the Buildings are placed closer than the calculated distance, they will be marked red (assuming that Too low distance between Buildings is active). Min. Dist.
