Getting to know its logic will help you easily integrate it into your regular workflow.\n\n\nInitialize Modelur\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce Modelur is installed you have two options to initialize it. First option is to click on the blue icon in Modelur Toolbar. This toolbar shows up once Modelur you install Modelur (Figure 3.01). \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.01 - Modelur Toolbar. If toolbar is not visible, you can open it via SketchUp menu View --> Toolbars --> Modelur. To initialize it, click on the blue Modelur icon. This toolbar can be stacked next to other toolbars in SketchUp.\n\n\n\nSecond option to initialize Modelur is to navigate to it through SketchUp menu \nPlugins \u2192 Modelur \u2192 Initialize Modelur\n (Figure 3.02).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.02 - Alternative way to initialize Modelur through SketchUp menu Plugins --> Modelur --> Initialize Modelur. Please note that Plugins menu was called Extensions in previous versions of SketchUp.\n\n\n\nOnce Modelur is initialized, its user interface is opened. Modelur's main User Interface (UI, Figure 3.03) is composed of four parts: Menu, Tabs, Panels and Statusbar.\n\n\nUser Interface Overview\n\u00b6\n\n\nMenu\n\u00b6\n\n\nMenu is located at the top of the User Interface. It is the place where you go to when you want to save data (e.g. export Urban Control Indicators), change preferences (e.g. Language) or get some help (e.g. open this User Guide). Detailed description is available in the Menu section.\n\n\nTabs\n\u00b6\n\n\nTabs are located below the Menu. They represent a groups of similar tasks. Currently there are four of them: Whole Plot tab (a place to set default values for the whole plot), Land Use tab (a place to create and edit Land Uses and their parameters), Building tab (a place to modify selected Buildings) and Survey (a place where you can monitor Urban Control Indicators). Detailed description is available in the Tabs section.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.03 -  Structure of Modelur's User Interface.\n\n\n\nPanels\n\u00b6\n\n\nPanels are the windows inside each tab. They represent a group of related parameters (e.g. Plot Parameters or Land Use Requirements). Detailed description is available in each of the corresponding Tabs section.\n\n\nStatus Bar\n\u00b6\n\n\nStatusbar is located at the bottom of the UI. It's task is to explain you the meaning of abbreviated text when you hover over it. You can turn Status bar on or of in Menu \u2192 Options \u2192 Show status bar.\n\n\nQuick Start Guide\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore you start\n\u00b6\n\n\nMake sure you have \ninstalled Modelur\n and quickly check out the \nstructure of Modelur User Interface\n, so you get acquainted with basic terminology and UI logic. It should not take you more than two and a half minutes. :-)\n\n\nStep 1 - Initialize Modelur model and configure it\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet's start from the very beginning. With SketchUp open you can initialize Modelur by clicking on a blue Modelur icon in toolbar or via SketchUp menu \nExtensions \u2192 Modelur \u2192 Initialize Modelur\n (as shown in \nUI Overview\n section). Once initialized, go to Options menu to set Modelur UI Language and dimension units (meters or feet) according to your needs (Figure 3.04).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.04 -  Inside Options menu you can set preferred language, dimension units, default shape when Buildings are created, etc. You can find detailed information about all Options inside \nUser Interface\n section.\n\n\n\nStep 2 - Create Modelur Building\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce Modelur is initialized and set up, you can already create Modelur Building by either clicking on a yellow Modelur Building icon in the Toolbar (1), by clicking on the \nCreate Building\n (2) entry in SketchUp menu \nExtensions \u2192 Modelur\n or by clicking on the Create button (3) inside Building tab of Modelur\u2019s user interface (Figure 3.05).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.05 - Buttons through which you can create Modelur Buildings.\n\n\n\nRegardless of which way you choose to create Modelur Buildings, there are always two options - you can create a Building based on a predefined floor plan or based on what you draw. We will take a look at these two in the following paragraphs.\n\n\nCreating Building based on predefined shape\n\n\nIf nothing is selected in your .skp model, Modelur will create a Building with predefined floor plan. This can be selected under Modelur\u2019s \nOptions \u2192 Default building shape\n as shown below. At the moment (Modelur v0.5.7), you can chose among three basic floor plans - Square, Circle and L-Shape (Figure 3.06).\n\n\nWhen new Building is initialized this way, it is created based on the default Parameters as specified for the Whole Plot or Parametric Maps (if defined). We will take a look at those later.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.06 - Different shapes of Buildings when you create a Building and no Face or Edge is selected.\n\n\n\nCreating Building based on specific floor plan shape\n\n\nMore commonly, you will want to create your own floor plan and create Building based on its shape. To do this, simply draw a horizontal face (Modelur will select it automatically if it is being created) using standard SketchUp\u2019s procedure, or select existing face, and click on Create Building button (Figure 3.07). This will create a new Modelur Building based on selected face and default parameters.\n\n\nAlternatively you can also create Building based on selected closed edge loop. To do so, select at least one edge of the loop and click on Create Building button.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.07 - You can create Modelur Building based on any floor plan shape. Just make sure Face or Edge is selected and click on the Create Building button.\n\n\n\nStep 3 - Changing the Parameters\n\u00b6\n\n\nParameters work hierarchically in Modelur. What this means is that an object (Building) first looks if its parameter in question (eg. Number of Storeys) is defined. If yes, it uses it. If not, it uses the Parameter from its superior object, which is Parametric Map. If Parametric map does not exist or it is inactive, it takes the value as defined in Whole Plot, which is superior object to Parametric Map. Whole Plot is the topmost object in Modelur.\n\n\nObject hierarchy for all Building Parameters in current version of Modelur (Beta) is: \nBuilding \u2192 Parametric Map \u2192 Whole Plot\n.\n\n\nOverloaded Parameters\n\u00b6\n\n\nFrom now on we will call the Parameters that are defined for specific Buildings \"overloaded\" Parameters. This term applies only to the specific Parameters of specific Buildings. Eg. when we define Parameter for Number of Storeys in Building A, but not in Building B, only the Building A has overloaded parameter for Number of Storeys. We can quickly check which Parameters are overloaded by selecting the Building in question and opening Building tab in Modelur User Interface (Figure 3.08). There - under Selected Building Parameters panel - all overloaded Parameters are checked and ready to be changed. This is also the place to initialize overloaded Parameters. If we want to change, eg. Land Use of the Building, go ahead - check it and change its value.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.08 - You can quickly check if some of the Building Parameters are overloaded in Selected Building Parameters panel (under Building tab). If checkbox is marked, the Parameter is overloaded; this means that the Building will not change when value of this parameter is changed in its superior object (Whole Plot or Parametric Map). If you do not want the Building to have any parameter overloaded, simply click on a Restore button inside Selected Building Parameters panel.\n\n\n\nPlease note that overloading / changing one Parameter might also overload other, connected parameters. For example, when you overload Number of Storeys parameter, this will also overload Building Height and Gross Floor Area Parameters, as they are directly connected to Number of Storeys. In other words, when Number of Storeys change, Building\u2019s Height and Gross Floor Area change, too.",

This term applies only to the specific Parameters of specific Buildings. Eg. when we define Parameter for Number of Storeys in Building A, but not in Building B, only the Building A has overloaded parameter for Number of Storeys. We can quickly check which Parameters are overloaded by selecting the Building in question and opening Building tab in Modelur User Interface (Figure 3.08). There - under Selected Building Parameters panel - all overloaded Parameters are checked and ready to be changed. This is also the place to initialize overloaded Parameters. If we want to change, eg. Land Use of the Building, go ahead - check it and change its value.   Figure 3.08 - You can quickly check if some of the Building Parameters are overloaded in Selected Building Parameters panel (under Building tab). If checkbox is marked, the Parameter is overloaded; this means that the Building will not change when value of this parameter is changed in its superior object (Whole Plot or Parametric Map). If you do not want the Building to have any parameter overloaded, simply click on a Restore button inside Selected Building Parameters panel.  Please note that overloading / changing one Parameter might also overload other, connected parameters. For example, when you overload Number of Storeys parameter, this will also overload Building Height and Gross Floor Area Parameters, as they are directly connected to Number of Storeys. In other words, when Number of Storeys change, Building\u2019s Height and Gross Floor Area change, too.",

Thank you Edgar Navas and Xiaoqi Wang!  Bugfix: Fixed wrong dropdown translations for primary and secondary Land Use units when language is changed.  Bugfix: No more user interface freezing when the defaulut language is switched to Chinese.  Bugfix: Land Use Requirements panel is now properly refreshed when last Land Use in dropdown is deleted.  Bugfix: Primary and secondary units are now refreshed properly when language is changed on Windows platform.   0.3.1 (Pre-beta 3)   Enhancement: Added error message when uncompatible version of Modelur model is opened.  Enhancement: Improved undo mechanism for deleted buildings. They are now recreated properly; nonetheless they should be avoided as much as possible as it might lead to unexpected behaviour when used repeatedly.  Engancement: Added exporting of Urban control value survey. Users can select which data they would like to export: Whole Plot, Land Uses and Buildings.  Enhancement: Added option to choose the default shape of the building when creating it with no faces selected. Supported shapes: square, circle and L-shaped building.  Enhancement: Improved Modelur icons.  Enhancement: Improved Modelur version upgrade system and initialization methods.  Enhancement: Added Modelur Help options (video tutorials, forum, blog, ...)  Bugfix: Fixed Land Use survey calculations when opening saved models.  Bugfix: Location of built-up area face inside the building if it is not on the horizontal plane.  Bugfix: Fixed showing of terraces and loggias using materials.  Bugfix: Calculation of number of primary units (e.g. appartments) and required parking lots due to Length class rounding error.  Bugfix: Fixed saving of default settings.   0.3.0 (Pre-beta 3)   Major Modelur core engine and user interface update. Most of the code rewritten.  Enhancement: Added dynamic Land Use system, so end-users can add their own land uses. Land uses can also be renamed.  Enhancement: Added Modelur Toolbar with Initialize Modelur,Create Building and Copy building buttons.  Enhancement: Improved mechanism for duplicating buildings via Value Control Box.  Enhancement: If no face is selected when a user wants to create a building Modelur creates it automatically. User can choose between square, circular or L shape.  Enhancement: Added option to colour terrace and loggia floors so end-users can check if correct faces as marked.  Enhancement: Renaming land use material in SketchUp also renames the land use itself. Vice versa works only on SketchUp 8M1 and above.  Enhancement: Added SketchUp Modelur menu language translations.  Enhancement: Added user interface Status Bar, which explains abbreviations.  Known limitation: undoing Modelur parameter changes works only partially.   0.2.9 (Pre-beta 2)   This is the last version of Modelur Pre-beta 2. It will stop to work on 31 st  of July 2013. Please note that Modelur Pre-beta 3 will not be backward compatible!   0.2.8 (Pre-beta 2)   Bugfix: Multiple buildings can now again be created in one step.   0.2.7 (Pre-beta 2)   Exporting urban control values now also exports the values for each building and marks buildings in 3D model by their unique IDs (marks are placed to layer Buildings UIDs).   0.2.6 (Pre-beta 2)   Improved performance of realtime distance checking between buildings.  Improved VCB copying mechanism.  Improved online validation mechanism, which is now executed only when Modelur is initialized. Additionaly, it fixes an error when Modelur's validation server is unreachable.   0.2.5 (Pre-beta 2)   Beginning with version 0.2.5, Modelur works also with Google SketchUp 8.  Enhancement: Improved Chinese translation of user interface. Thank you Wantao Xiao!  Fixed changing of metric/imperial units.   0.2.4 (Pre-beta 2)   Major stability improvement when buildings are being duplicated extensively in 3d view.  Enhancement: Dutch translation of user interface. Thank you Gertjan Laurenssen!  Enhancement: Spanish translation of user interface. Thank you Diego Rodriguez!  Enhancement: 'Invisible' UI scroller. Usage: select a building, click on input field (i.e. Building \u2192 Number of storeys), press Shift key and scroll mouse wheel - selected building will update itself to the new value. Change scroll stepping by holding Ctrl in addition to Shift key.  Enhancement: Automatic fixing of rotated floor plans when creating building. Modelur now tries to create orthogonal bounding box for buildings, so they can easily be scaled.  Enhancement: Basic optimization of buildings for Google Earth export. Optimized geometry can be found in Modelur2GE layer. This feature is still in development.  Enhancement: Improved input parameters handling. User interface can now accept different styles of input data (i.e. decimals written with dot or comma, whitespaces, alphabet characters) and handles them automatically.  Enhancement: Newly drawn (floor plan) faces are now selected automatically, so it one does not have to select it by hand in order to create Modelur building from it.  Enhancement: Newly created buildings now get the default name 'Building', so one can easily found them in the Outliner.  Enhancement: Improved calculation of mixed use ratio.  Fixed bug which prevented to duplicate last duplicated building in 3d view using Ctrl/Cmd key.  Fixed bug for 'Manually drawn floor plan assumes default built area' checkbox.  Fixed creation of building when default number of storeys is 1.   0.2.3 (Pre-beta 2)   Hotfix for bug, which prevented to set plot area size and parking lots normatives.   0.2.2 (Pre-beta 2)   Huge performance optimization when opening .skp model with many Modelur buildings. Model now opens 10-50 times faster.  Optimized performance of urban control values calculation (about 30% faster).  Improved communication speed between Modelur user interface and its engine.  Improved reaction to scale tool.  Improved calculation of built area.  Improved checking of user defined parameter values in user interface.  Added Chinese translation of user interface. Thank you Huaqiao Wang and James Baq!   0.2.1 (Pre-beta 2)   Improved calculation of building volume and built area.  Fixed bug of gross floor area calculation when terrace or loggia normative is changed.  Fixed undo/redo stack (SketchUp 7).  User interface bug fixes.  Fixed bug that prevented realtime update of building control values when user changed parameter of terrace or loggia percent.   0.2.0 (Pre-beta 2)   Advanced manual editing of buildings which enables the creation of terraces and loggias. How much they contribute to gross floor area of building is defined as percentage, in Terrace gross floor area percent and Loggia gross floor area percent, respectively.  Menus added to the user interface, which now works on Internet Explorer 6 also.  Modelur now works offline too, yet it has some limitations.  Export of urban control values to .csv file.  Calculation of net floor area, based on percentage of gross floor area. Defined as Percent of usable gross floor area.  Distance units can now be switched between metric (meters) and imperial (feet).  Warnings about minimal distance between buildings (default 4m).  Simplified applying of texture to the terrain.  Polish translation of user interface. Thank you Tomasz Gutowski.  Duplication of buildings via Value Control Box together with some other minor bugfixes.   0.1.1 (Pre-beta 1)   Modelur is now available also on Apple Mac OS X.  We have also added French, German and Portuguese translations of user interface. Thank you Pilou, Burkhard and Edson from Sketchucation!   0.1.0 (Pre-beta 1)  This is the initial release of Modelur Pre-beta version.",
