<li>Enhancement: More intuitive handling of overloaded parameters, when they are set back to default values.</li>
<li>Bugfix: HeadsUp Display showing Building and Whole Plot values is now loaded properly (as defined by user preferences) when .skp model is opened.</li>

<li>Bugfix: Building terraces and loggias are now properly marked (according to preference) when .skp model is opened.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>0.3.4 (Pre-beta 3)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancement: Modelur remembers changes on the user interface layout.</li>
<li>Enhancement: When Modelur is run for the first time, it loads in the language of SketchUp if translation exists.</li>
<li>Enhancement: Options 'Calculate sum values of selected Buildings', 'Optimize Building for Google Earth', 'Toggle Built-up Area visibility', 'Toggle terraces and loggias' moved from Sketchup Plugins menu to the user interface</li>

<li>Bugfix: Multiple buildings can now again be created in one step.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.2.7 (Pre-beta 2)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exporting urban control values now also exports the values for each building and marks buildings in 3D model by their unique IDs (marks are placed to layer Buildings UIDs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.2.6 (Pre-beta 2)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance of realtime distance checking between buildings.</li>
<li>Improved VCB copying mechanism.</li>
<li>Improved online validation mechanism, which is now executed only when Modelur is initialized. Additionaly, it fixes an error when Modelur's validation server is unreachable.</li>
</ul>
