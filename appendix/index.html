<li>Enhancement: Spanish translation of user interface. Thank you Diego Rodriguez!</li>
<li>Enhancement: 'Invisible' UI scroller. Usage: select a building, click on input field (i.e. Building → Number of storeys), press Shift key and scroll mouse wheel - selected building will update itself to the new value. Change scroll stepping by holding Ctrl in addition to Shift key.</li>
<li>Enhancement: Automatic fixing of rotated floor plans when creating building. Modelur now tries to create orthogonal bounding box for buildings, so they can easily be scaled.</li>
<li>Enhancement: Basic optimization of buildings for Google Earth export. Optimized geometry can be found in Modelur2GE layer. This feature is still in development.</li>
<li>Enhancement: Improved input parameters handling. User interface can now accept different styles of input data (i.e. decimals written with dot or comma, whitespaces, alphabet characters) and handles them automatically.</li>
<li>Enhancement: Newly drawn (floor plan) faces are now selected automatically, so it one does not have to select it by hand in order to create Modelur building from it.</li>
<li>Enhancement: Newly created buildings now get the default name 'Building', so one can easily found them in the Outliner.</li>
<li>Enhancement: Improved calculation of mixed use ratio.</li>
<li>Fixed bug which prevented to duplicate last duplicated building in 3d view using Ctrl/Cmd key.</li>
<li>Fixed bug for 'Manually drawn floor plan assumes default built area' checkbox.</li>
<li>Fixed creation of building when default number of storeys is 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.2.3 (Pre-beta 2)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hotfix for bug, which prevented to set plot area size and parking lots normatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.2.2 (Pre-beta 2)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Huge performance optimization when opening .skp model with many Modelur buildings. Model now opens 10-50 times faster.</li>
<li>Optimized performance of urban control values calculation (about 30% faster).</li>
<li>Improved communication speed between Modelur user interface and its engine.</li>
<li>Improved reaction to scale tool.</li>
<li>Improved calculation of built area.</li>
<li>Improved checking of user defined parameter values in user interface.</li>
<li>Added Chinese translation of user interface. Thank you Huaqiao Wang and James Baq!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.2.1 (Pre-beta 2)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved calculation of building volume and built area.</li>
<li>Fixed bug of gross floor area calculation when terrace or loggia normative is changed.</li>
<li>Fixed undo/redo stack (SketchUp 7).</li>
<li>User interface bug fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented realtime update of building control values when user changed parameter of terrace or loggia percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.2.0 (Pre-beta 2)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced manual editing of buildings which enables the creation of terraces and loggias. How much they contribute to gross floor area of building is defined as percentage, in Terrace gross floor area percent and Loggia gross floor area percent, respectively.</li>
<li>Menus added to the user interface, which now works on Internet Explorer 6 also.</li>
<li>Modelur now works offline too, yet it has some limitations.</li>
<li>Export of urban control values to .csv file.</li>
<li>Calculation of net floor area, based on percentage of gross floor area. Defined as Percent of usable gross floor area.</li>
<li>Distance units can now be switched between metric (meters) and imperial (feet).</li>
<li>Warnings about minimal distance between buildings (default 4m).</li>
<li>Simplified applying of texture to the terrain.</li>
<li>Polish translation of user interface. Thank you Tomasz Gutowski.</li>
<li>Duplication of buildings via Value Control Box together with some other minor bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.1.1 (Pre-beta 1)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modelur is now available also on Apple Mac OS X.</li>
<li>We have also added French, German and Portuguese translations of user interface. Thank you Pilou, Burkhard and Edson from Sketchucation!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>0.1.0 (Pre-beta 1)</strong></p>
<p>This is the initial release of Modelur Pre-beta version.</p>
