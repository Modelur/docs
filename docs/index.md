Welcome to Modelur User Guide!
===================

[Modelur](https://modelur.eu) is a parametric urban design tool that helps architects, urban designers and planners quickly create urban design projects and make well-informed decisions during the early stages of urban design. Modelur achieves this by employing parametric modeling approach and real-time calculation of key urban control parameters, such as Floor Area Ratio, Built-up Area or Required number of Parking Lots on-the-fly.

Modelur is implemented as a plug-in for [Trimble SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com).

Although we strive to make Modelur as intuitive as possible, we can not escape the need for good user documentation. Please note that this documentation is part of Modelur Beta release. As such, it is still work in progress and it will be updated quite a lot during the following months. If you find some mistake or you miss some explanation, please drop us an [e-mail](mailto:support@modelur.com).
