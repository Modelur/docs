Under City Block tab you can add, edit or remove City Blocks, using which you can separate the whole development into smaller parts for which Urban Control Values (eg. FAR) are calculated separately. Although this is best suited for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_unit_development" target="_blank">Planned Unit Development</a>, it is also highly usable with other zoning systems.
