Plot Parameters
---------------

**Plot area** is the size of the whole development area. This parameter is used to calculate Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Site Coverage.
 
**Min. Distance to Height Ratio** is used to calculate minimum distance between two Buildings based on their heights. To calculate distance, the Building's height is divided by the parameter value. Example: if parameter is set to 2, the minimum distance will be 1/2 of Building's height, if set to 3, it will be 1/3 of Building's height. If the Buildings are placed closer than the calculated distance, they will be marked red (presuming that [Too low distance between Buildings](survey/#warnings) is active).

**Min. Dist. Between Buildings** is the absolute distance (in meters of feet) between any two Buildings. If the Buildings are placed closer than this specified distance, they will be marked red (presuming that [Too low distance between Buildings](survey/#warnings) is active).
