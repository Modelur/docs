#### Menu
Menu is located on top of the UI. It is the place where you go to when you want to save data (e.g. export Urban Control Indicators), change preferences (e.g. Language) or get some help (e.g. open this User Guide). Detailed description is available in the Menu section.

#### Tabs
Tabs are located below the Menu. They represent a groups of similar tasks. Currently there are four of them: Whole Plot tab (a place to set default values for the whole plot), Land Use tab (a place to create and edit Land Uses and their parameters), Building tab (a place to modify selected Buildings) and Survey (a place where you can monitor Urban Control Indicators). Detailed description is available in the Tabs section.

#### Panels
Panels are the windows inside each tab. They represent a group of related parameters (e.g. Plot Parameters or Land Use Requirements). Detailed description is available in each of the corresponding Tabs section.

#### Status Bar
Statusbar is located at the bottom of the UI. It's task is to explain you the meaning of abbreviated text when you hover over it. You can turn Status bar on or of in Menu > Options > Show status bar.
